# to zadanie jest troche bardziej skomplikowane, trzeba pamietac jak dziala
# metoda input(), w tym wypadku napisalismy ze metoda input sluzy do wyznaczenia
# zmiennej letter! Metoda input zatrzymuje wykonywanie kodu do momentu a≈º uzytkownik
# nie wstuka jakiegos inputu, po czym nacisnie enter, wtedy wartosc input staje
# sie zmienna "letter" i wykonuje reszte kodu
